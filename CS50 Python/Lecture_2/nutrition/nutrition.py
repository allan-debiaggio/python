"""
Implement a program that :
- Prompts users to input a fruit(case insensitively)
- Outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit
(per the FDA's poster for fruits, which is also available as text)
- Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits
exactly as written in the poster (e.g., "strawberries", not "strawberry")
- Ignore any input that isn't a fruit
